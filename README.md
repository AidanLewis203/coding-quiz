# coding-quiz

## Description
This is an application that is used to quiz your knowledge of coding. It uses several web APIs to accomplish this. I built this project as a test of my abilities with JavaScript and the aforementioned APIs.

## Usage
When using this application you should be able to select the start quiz button and go through the quiz to recieve a score. If you answer a questiom incorrectly you'll have time deducted from your score. Upon completing the quiz and receiving a score you will be asked to submit your initials to save a highscore on the quiz.
